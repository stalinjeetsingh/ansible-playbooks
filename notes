Ansible is open source software that automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. 
Ansible connects via SSH, remote PowerShell.
It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure.
it uses a very simple language (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to 
describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.
Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called "Ansible modules" to them.
Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH by default), and removes them when finished.

Here's what a plain text inventory file looks like:

[webservers]
www1.example.com
www2.example.com

[dbservers]
db0.example.com
db1.example.com
