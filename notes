Ansible is open source software that automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. 
Ansible connects via SSH, remote PowerShell.
It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure.
it uses a very simple language (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to 
describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.
Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called "Ansible modules" to them.
Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH by default), and removes them when finished.

## in case you are using google cloud, create a private and public key pair 
https://qsandbox.com/tools/private-public-keygen

save public key as dev.pub and private key as dev.pem in notepad
add dev.pub in metadata field of google vm
for private key, simply cd ~ than vi dev.pem and paste dev.pem content. than chmod 600 dev.pem.

it can connect to 100 of servers at the same time and can run task all at once which is not possible even with a scripting.

Here's what a plain text inventory file looks like:

[webservers]
www1.example.com
www2.example.com

[dbservers]
db0.example.com
db1.example.com

*******Lets start*****************
on your Linux machine
sudo yum install ansible -y

vi hosts
[myservers]
hotsname or ip

-u username (in case you have not setup for password less communication)
-i for inventory
--private-key=devops.pem (in case you have not set the path of private key in etc.cnf file)
syntax:
ansible-playbook - hosts --private-key=devops.pem useradd.yml
##useradd.yml is a yml file to add a user

- name: to adda user
  hosts: all 
  become: yes
  tasks:
   - name: adding user 
     user: 
       name: stalin
       shell: /bin/false
       uid: 1010
       group: 100

   vars_prompt: to ask for varibale as input at run
   -e url1= www.google.com (to pass varibale in cli while running the command)
   -m setup ## to gather facts. Its the default moudlue which ansible run to gather facts
   -t tagname
   register: out (out will store the output) or out.stdout
   vars_file:
        -name: read var from file
         hosts: all
         vars_file: 
               - vars.yml
    we have already created a vars.yml to put our varibales there.vars.yml is a separate file to store our input.
