Ansible is open source software that automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. 
Ansible connects via SSH, remote PowerShell.
It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure.
it uses a very simple language (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to 
describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.
Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called "Ansible modules" to them.
Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH by default), and removes them when finished.

save public key as dev.pub and private key as dev.pem in notepad
add dev.pub in metadata field of google vm
for private key, simply cd ~ than vi dev.pem and paste dev.pem content. tahn chmod 600 dev.pem.

*******Lets start*****************
on your Linux machine
sudo yum install ansible -y

vi hosts
[myservers]
hotsname or ip

-u username (in case you have not setup for password less communication)
-i for inventory
--private-key=devops.pem (in case you have not set the path of private key in etc.cnf file)
syntax:
ansible-playbook - hosts --private-key=devops.pem useradd.yml
##useradd.yml is a yml file to add a user
